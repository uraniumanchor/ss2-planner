# System Shock 2 Build Planner

Just a simple, unstyled React app to help you plan out your build. Will take into account your initial training
selections. Eventually it will help you plan out the order, as well. Bug reports and pull requests are welcome but I
don't expect this to grow much beyond the current feature set.

Should work in most modern browsers. IE11 does not count.
